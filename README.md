### BOIDS

An attempt to reproduce "Hungry AI" which I found on Bit-101 years ago. Hungry AI was a flash simulation written in AS3 but has since been lost.

* The boids have a certain amount of "food" which goes down each time they move
* When at a certain level of food they must seek a food source
* When seeking food they must also "arrive" at the food
* As the boids eat the food, they food source must deplete (the boid must stick to the outside edge of the food as it shrinks)
* Once the food source is depleted, a new food source must be added
